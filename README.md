### Technologies for Development (betraying my love for GitHub)

- **[Generative AI](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - IMHO, products like Co-Pilot are interesting and useful. 
- **[Container-based Dev](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** - Define your dev environment in code. Use tools like Docker or Codespaces, develop in a container.
- **[Pipelines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)** - Anything manually can be automated in code. 

### Tools I use Every Day
