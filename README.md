## Hi there. Please Follow and/or Sponsor me. üëã

My interests revolve around the modernization of software development processes. For me, this entails the use of generative AI in coding, container-based development, and the expression of all software development processes through git-driven pipelines. I have a particular interest in how test-oriented processes are integrated into software development, how they inform developer decisions, support developer/team productivity, and produce quality software. 

### Organization Content
1. üíô **Jit CI Product Review** - [Overview & Security Plan repo, defined in code](https://github.com/ppottorff/jitrepo)
2. üèóÔ∏è **Containerized Dev Environment** - [This project provides a vanilla continerized dev environment.](https://github.com/ppottorff/Containerized-Dev-Environment/)
3. üèóÔ∏è **Containerized SliDev Environment** - It's rough. [Working on a project to create slide decks, using SliDev, in a container.](https://github.com/ppottorff/Containerized-SliDev-Environment)
4. :notebook: [Code with Engineering Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook) - Playbook for engineering teams. Reference for MkDocs in a well-designed pipeline.

### Technologies for Development (betraying my love for GitHub)

- **[Generative AI](https://github.com/features/copilot)** - Products like Co-Pilot make any developer more productive. IMHO, it is not a crutch for the weak.
- **[Container-based Dev](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** - Define your dev environment in code. Use tools like Docker or Codespaces, develop in a container.
- **[Pipelines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)** - Anything manually can be automated in code. 

### Tools I use Every Day
